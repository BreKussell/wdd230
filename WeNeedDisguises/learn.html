                  A box cutter is going to be your best friend when working with
                  foams. It makes getting around curves and tight places easier than
                  trying to use scissors

                 Sandpaper is very useful. You can technically use it for carving
                 foam it's just not recommended. What sandpaper is most useful for is
                 for pulling of finishes from things such as PVC so it can be
                 painted. Another thing that Sandpaper is good for is taking off
                 layer lines off your 3D prints to give them that smooth finish that
                 you see on 3D printed armor sets.

                    Heat guns are one of the most important tools that you could have.
                    They're used for foam to heat seal it so it's not porous allowing it
                     to be primed quicker and be painted with less paint. They're also
                     used for heating the foam so it can be shaped into something it's
                     not flat. Heat guns are also used when working with worbla making it
                       shapeable as well.

                  Pins can be used for more than just sewing. They can be used when
                      tracing your patterns on to softer materials like foams. and they're
                    useful when styling wigs, being used to hold the wig onto the wig
                    head preventing movement.

                 Many EVA foams are black, having a nice metalic marker is the idea for tracing patterns on to it. Silver is ideal.

                  are the equipment that makes the connections between your microchip
                  and LED lights. The colors are highly recommended so you can tell

                  Worbla isn’t a material that you want to use excessively but it
                  works great when you want to reinforce foam builds, or when you want

                 in it cover it with tape and draw the pattern directly onto the
                 tape.

            <h2>Tips for getting started!</h2>
            <h3>Choose Your Character!</h3>
            <p>
                A good first step to take is to pick your favorite character
                you want to bring to life. He, she, it, they, can be from a 
                video game, manga, anime, movie, comic or cartoon. Remember, 
                it doesn't matter what age, race, or gender you are, nor does 
                your body shape matter. Cosplay is for anyone, so just have 
                fun doing it.
            </p>

            <h3>Find a Reference</h3>
            <p>
                There are numerous to make a costume, ranging anywhere from 
                a beginner's skill level to advanced and covering a large
                variety of materials and techniques. If you don't know where
                to start, the internet is a great place to learn any skill 
                or technique. Remember, a costume doesn't need to cost your 
                life savings, a armor set can be made out of cardboard, or 
                even a floor mat. Just by looking at what other people have 
                done in the cosplay community is plenty to get a starting point.
                <br /> Here's some places to get started:

            <h3>Everyone has to Start Somewhere</h3>
            <p>As much as you may desire it, no one starts out a master-level Cosplayer,
                we started out wearing car mats as armor with store bought swords. Failing
                is a important process of cosplaying allowing for learning and growing. Just
                remember, don't be too hard on yourself, you're your own worst enemy if you 
                dig yourself into a perfectionist hole. Use failing as a drive to get better
                and don't compare your skills with other peoples.
